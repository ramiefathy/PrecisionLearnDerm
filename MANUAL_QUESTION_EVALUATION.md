#### **Areas for Improvement** ⚠️

1. **Option Quality Issues**
   - **Critical Flaw**: Question 2 has duplicate answers (Ataxia-telangiectasia = Louis-Bar syndrome)
   - Some questions have options that could be more challenging

2. **Difficulty Calibration**
   - Several questions are too easy (Questions 10, 11, 16, 19, 20)
   - May not achieve optimal 70-80% success rate
   - Need more challenging distractors

3. **Educational Value Variation**
   - Some questions provide basic learning opportunities
   - Could include more teaching points in explanations

#### **Specific Technical Flaws**

1. **Question 2 (Ataxia-Telangiectasia)**: 
   - **MAJOR FLAW**: Options A and B are the same condition
   - Violates homogeneity requirements
   - Creates technical error that could invalidate question

#### **Difficulty Distribution Analysis**

- **Too Easy** (5 questions): May exceed 90% success rate
- **Appropriate** (13 questions): Likely 70-80% success rate  
- **Too Hard** (2 questions): May fall below 70% success rate

### **Final Assessment**

**Overall ABD Compliance: 85.7% - EXCELLENT**

The sample demonstrates **strong adherence** to ABD guidelines with:
- ✅ Excellent clinical vignette construction
- ✅ Perfect structural compliance
- ✅ Strong bottom-up reasoning
- ✅ Good medical accuracy
