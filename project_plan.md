## üö® **CRITICAL BLOCKERS** 

### **1. ~~Deployment Infrastructure Failure~~ ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Status**: FIXED - NPM issues resolved, functions building successfully
**Resolution**: 
- Fixed package management with clean reinstall script
- Removed problematic dependencies
- Functions now compile without errors

### **2. Security Vulnerabilities** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Status**: RESOLVED - Critical security issues addressed
**Fixed Issues**:
- Removed hardcoded admin email authentication
- Implemented Firebase Custom Claims for RBAC
- Secured API keys with Firebase Functions Secrets
- No more secrets in CI/CD pipeline

**Remaining Setup**:
1. Run `firebase functions:secrets:set GEMINI_API_KEY`
2. Grant initial admin: `node scripts/set-admin-claim.js <email>`
3. Deploy with new security: `firebase deploy --only functions,firestore:rules,storage:rules`

### **3. Database Content Vacuum** üî• URGENT  
**Status**: PREVENTING USER TESTING
**Issue**: Firestore `items` collection completely empty
**Impact**: No quiz content available, core functionality non-demonstrable
**Root Cause**: Seed function exists but requires successful deployment

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Deploy Cloud Functions successfully
2. Execute seed function to populate sample questions
3. Validate quiz flow with populated content
4. Implement content import pipeline for scale
