## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Pipeline Architecture (`pipelineEnhanced.ts`)

The new enhanced pipeline implements a multi-stage quality assurance process:

```typescript
Pipeline Stages:
1. Generation → 2. Validation → 3. Medical Check → 4. Improvement → 5. Scoring
```

#### Quality Thresholds:
- **Minimum**: 15/25 - Basic acceptable quality
- **Target**: 18/25 - Standard production quality
- **Excellent**: 20/25 - High-quality questions
- **Max Iterations**: 5 - Balance between quality and performance

#### Validation Rules:

| Component | Requirements | Validation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Stem** | 50-500 chars, clinical context | ✅ Length check, keyword detection |
| **Lead-in** | 10-100 chars, question format | ✅ Format validation, question mark |
| **Options** | Exactly 5, unique, plausible | ✅ Count, uniqueness, length checks |
| **Explanation** | 100-1000 chars, references answer | ✅ Length, content relevance |

### 2. Medical Accuracy System

The pipeline now includes automated medical accuracy checks:

```javascript
Medical Accuracy Checks:
- Contradiction detection between stem and answer
- Treatment appropriateness validation
- Clinical scenario consistency
- Distractor plausibility assessment
```

#### Common Issues Detected:
- ❌ Antibiotics suggested for non-bacterial conditions
- ❌ Incorrect primary treatments for specific conditions
- ❌ Generic or implausible distractors
- ❌ Missing clinical context in scenarios

### 3. Self-Improvement Mechanism

The pipeline automatically improves questions through:

1. **Error Correction**: Fixes structural issues (missing elements, duplicates)
2. **Content Enhancement**: Adds clinical context, expands explanations
3. **Format Standardization**: Ensures consistent question format
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Re-evaluates and improves until quality threshold met
