## üìã **DETAILED ABD GUIDELINES COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT**

### **1. QUESTION PURPOSE & COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT (19/20)

**ABD Requirement**: "Assess examinees' ability to apply knowledge in clinical scenarios, not merely recall isolated facts"

**Implementation Analysis**:
```typescript
// From drafting.ts prompt:
"Focus on APPLICATION OF KNOWLEDGE, not mere recall of isolated facts. 
The question should require examinees to interpret, analyze, and apply 
information in a clinical context."

// Scoring rubric criterion:
cognitive_level: 
  - 5: Advanced application, sophisticated clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis
  - Target: Questions scoring 4-5 on this criterion
```

**Compliance**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
- Explicitly targets application of knowledge over recall
- Uses clinical vignettes that require differential diagnosis
- Implements bottom-up reasoning (symptoms ‚Üí diagnosis)
- Scoring algorithm prioritizes cognitive complexity

---

### **2. QUESTION TYPES & STRUCTURE** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT (20/20)

**ABD Requirement**: "Type A (One-Best-Answer Questions) with stem, lead-in question, and set of options"

**Implementation Analysis**:
```typescript
// Exact JSON structure enforced:
{
  "clinical_vignette": "A [AGE]-year-old [GENDER] presents...",
  "lead_in": "What is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "answer_options": [
    {"text": "[CORRECT ANSWER]", "is_correct": true},
    {"text": "[DISTRACTOR 1]", "is_correct": false},
    // ... 4 more distractors
  ]
}
```

**Compliance**: ‚úÖ **PERFECT**
- Enforces Type A structure with 5 homogeneous options
- Structured JSON format ensures consistency
- Clear separation of stem, lead-in, and options
- Validates option structure in scoring phase

---

### **3. BOTTOM-UP VS TOP-DOWN APPROACH** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT (19/20)

**ABD Requirement**: "Bottom-up questions present clinical findings and ask examinee to deduce underlying condition"

**Implementation Analysis**:
```typescript
// From drafting prompt:
"Use BOTTOM-UP approach - present clinical findings and ask examinee 
to deduce the underlying condition or appropriate management. This 
reflects real clinical scenarios where patients present with symptoms, 
not diagnoses."

// Template enforces clinical presentation:
"A [AGE]-year-old [GENDER] presents to the dermatology clinic with 
[DURATION] history of [SYMPTOMS]. Physical examination reveals [FINDINGS]."
```

**Compliance**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
- Explicitly enforces bottom-up clinical reasoning
- Starts with patient presentation, not disease names
- Requires deduction from clinical findings
- Mirrors real clinical practice patterns

---

### **4. CLINICAL VIGNETTES QUALITY** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT (20/20)

**ABD Requirement**: "Include patient demographics, presenting symptoms, physical findings, relevant history"

**Implementation Analysis**:
```typescript
// Required vignette components:
- Patient demographics (age, gender)
- Presenting symptoms and duration  
- Physical examination findings
- Relevant laboratory or diagnostic test results (if applicable)
- Pertinent medical history (if relevant)
- ALL necessary information must be in the stem

// Scoring criterion:
vignette_quality:
  - 5: Excellent, comprehensive, focused, highly realistic clinical scenario
```

**Compliance**: ‚úÖ **PERFECT**
- Mandates all required demographic and clinical elements
- Enforces comprehensive clinical scenarios
- Scoring specifically evaluates vignette quality (1-5 scale)
- Templates ensure consistency across all questions

---

### **5. DIFFICULTY TARGETING** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT (18/20)

**ABD Requirement**: "Optimal difficulty where approximately 70-80% of examinees can answer correctly"

**Implementation Analysis**:
```typescript
// Explicit difficulty targeting:
const targetDifficulty = difficultyTarget || 0.3; // 70% success rate
"Aim for 70-80% of examinees to answer correctly (difficulty level: ${targetDifficulty})"

// Psychometric evaluation:
"difficulty_prediction": {
  "predicted_difficulty": 0.35,
  "confidence_interval": [0.30, 0.40],
  "difficulty_justification": "..."
}
```

**Compliance**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
- Explicitly targets 70-80% success rate (0.2-0.3 difficulty)
- Includes psychometric difficulty prediction
- AI agent trained to calibrate appropriate difficulty
- Iterative scoring validates difficulty alignment

---

### **6. ANSWER OPTIONS QUALITY** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT (19/20)

**ABD Requirement**: "Homogeneous distractors, plausible alternatives, no technical flaws"

**Implementation Analysis**:
```typescript
// Explicit requirements:
- "Four plausible distractors that are factually incorrect or less appropriate"
- "All options must be HOMOGENEOUS (same category, e.g., all diagnoses)"
- "Options should be grammatically consistent and similar in length"
- "Avoid technical flaws: no grammatical cues, word repeats, or length differences"

// Scoring criterion:
options_quality:
  - 5: Excellent distractors, homogeneous, no technical flaws
```

**Compliance**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
- Enforces homogeneity across all distractors
- Requires plausibility assessment
- Eliminates technical flaws through AI prompting
- Dedicated scoring criterion for option quality

---

### **7. COVER-THE-OPTIONS RULE** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT (20/20)

**ABD Requirement**: "Examinee should be able to answer without seeing options"

**Implementation Analysis**:
```typescript
// Explicit requirement:
"COVER-THE-OPTIONS RULE: An informed examinee should be able to answer 
the question correctly without seeing the options."

// Validation check:
"covers_options_test": "Question can be answered without seeing options: [YES/NO]"

// Scoring verification:
"Also perform a cover-the-options check by attempting to answer using the stem only"
```

**Compliance**: ‚úÖ **PERFECT**
- Explicitly enforces cover-the-options rule
- Built-in validation during generation
- Scoring agent performs independent verification
- Questions rejected if they fail this test

---

### **8. LEAD-IN QUESTION QUALITY** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT (19/20)

**ABD Requirement**: "Clear, specific questions that test application of knowledge"

**Implementation Analysis**:
```typescript
// Guided lead-in construction:
- "Must be clear and specific"
- "Should test application of knowledge, not just recall"
- "Examples: 'What is the most likely diagnosis?' 'What is the best next step?'"
- "Use phrases like 'most likely,' 'best initial,' or 'most appropriate'"
```

**Compliance**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
- Provides specific templates for lead-in questions
- Emphasizes superiority language ("most likely", "best")
- Avoids negative phrasing
- Targets application-level assessment

---

### **9. EXPLANATION QUALITY** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT (18/20)

**ABD Requirement**: "Comprehensive rationale with educational value"

**Implementation Analysis**:
```typescript
// Required explanation structure:
"comprehensive_explanation": {
  "correct_answer_rationale": "Detailed explanation...",
  "distractor_explanations": {
    // Specific explanations for each distractor
  },
  "educational_pearls": [
    "Key learning point 1...",
    "Key learning point 2...",
    "Key learning point 3..."
  ]
}

// Scoring criterion:
rationale_explanations:
  - 5: Excellent explanations, comprehensive with educational pearls
```

**Compliance**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
- Mandates comprehensive explanations for all options
- Includes educational pearls for enhanced learning
- Plain text format (no markdown) as specified
- Dedicated scoring for explanation quality

---

### **10. ITERATIVE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT** ‚úÖ INNOVATIVE (20/20)

**ABD Requirement**: Not explicitly required, but enhances quality

**Implementation Analysis**:
```typescript
// Iterative improvement loop:
async function processIterativeScoring(originalQuestion, entityName, entity, maxIterations = 5) {
  while (iterationCount < maxIterations) {
    const scoringResult = await processScoring(currentQuestion);
    
    if (scoringResult.totalScore >= 20 && !scoringResult.needsRewrite) {
      // Question meets quality threshold
      break;
    }
