## Automated Testing Pipeline

### CI/CD Integration

The automated testing pipeline integrates with GitHub Actions and provides different test execution phases:

### Pre-Commit Phase
- **Duration**: 1-2 minutes
- **Tests**: Critical unit tests only
- **Trigger**: Git pre-commit hook
- **Purpose**: Fast feedback before code commit

### Continuous Integration Phase  
- **Duration**: 8-12 minutes
- **Tests**: Unit + Integration + Core E2E
- **Trigger**: Pull request or main branch push
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive validation before merge

### Deployment Validation Phase
- **Duration**: 15-20 minutes  
- **Tests**: Full test suite including load, chaos, recovery
- **Trigger**: Pre-deployment validation
- **Purpose**: Ensure deployment readiness

### Post-Deployment Phase
- **Duration**: 3-5 minutes
- **Tests**: Smoke tests + Performance validation  
- **Trigger**: After production deployment
- **Purpose**: Verify production system health

### Pipeline Execution Commands

```bash
# Pre-commit validation (fast, critical tests only)
npm run test:pipeline pre-commit

# Continuous integration (comprehensive testing)  
npm run test:pipeline continuous-integration --fail-fast

# Deployment validation (full test suite)
npm run test:pipeline deployment-validation --generate-reports --upload-artifacts

# Post-deployment verification
npm run test:pipeline post-deployment
```

### Quality Gates

The pipeline enforces strict quality gates before allowing deployments:

| Quality Gate | Threshold | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Code Coverage | 80% | Minimum line coverage required |
| Test Success Rate | 90% | Minimum test pass rate |
| Performance | < 2s avg response time | Maximum acceptable response time |
| Critical Test Pass | 100% | All critical tests must pass |
| Security Scan | No high/critical issues | Security vulnerabilities blocked |

## Mock Data and Test Fixtures

### Test Data Structure

```typescript
// Mock Question Data
const mockQuestions = {
  basic: {

    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The clinical presentation of well-demarcated plaques with silvery scales on extensor surfaces is characteristic of psoriasis vulgaris."
  }
};

// Mock AI Responses
const mockGeminiResponses = {
  successful: {
    response: {
      text: () => JSON.stringify(mockQuestions.basic)
    }
  },
  timeout: () => {
    throw new Error('Request timeout after 30 seconds');
