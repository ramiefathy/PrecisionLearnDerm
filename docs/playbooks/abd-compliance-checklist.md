### Playbook: ABD/NBME Compliance Checklist

Lead-in
- Positive, stand-alone; answerable without options (cover-the-options).
- Avoid EXCEPT/LEAST unless flagged for special review.

Options (A–E)
- Exactly five options; single best answer.
- Homogeneous class; avoid clang cues, length cues, absolutes (always/never).
- No duplicates or near-duplicates; no “all/none of the above”.

Stem
- Vignette scaffold: age/sex → setting → chief problem/duration → PMH/meds/exposures → morphology/distribution/timing → tests/images → lead-in.
- No PHI; respectful descriptors.

Explanations
- One per option (why correct, why incorrect); concise and accurate.

Images
- If present, alt text and caption mandatory; verify consent/compliance.

Validation
- Run validators: five options, single best, homogeneity, duplicate detection, negative-lead-in guard, cover-the-options heuristic.
