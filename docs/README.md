## Quick Reference

### Core API Endpoints
```typescript
// Enhanced MCQ Generation
const result = await functions.httpsCallable('ai_generate_enhanced_mcq')({
  topicIds: ['psoriasis'],
  difficulty: 0.6,
  strictMode: true
});

// Board-Style Generation
const question = await functions.httpsCallable('generateBoardStyleMcq')({
  topic: 'melanoma',
  difficulty: 'medium',
  focusArea: 'diagnosis'
});

// System Health Check
const health = await fetch('/systemHealth');
```

### Quality Thresholds
| Metric | Minimum | Target | Excellent |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Medical Accuracy | 85% | 90% | 95% |
| Structure Score | 75/100 | 85/100 | 90/100 |
| ABD Compliance | 70/100 | 80/100 | 85/100 |
| Overall Quality | 15/25 | 18/25 | 20/25 |

### Common Troubleshooting
- **API Key Issues**: `firebase functions:secrets:set GEMINI_API_KEY`
