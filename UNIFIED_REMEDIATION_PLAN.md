### 1.1 Type System Consolidation
**Objective:** Standardize on single source of truth for type definitions

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Standardize on QuestionItem Interface**
   ```typescript
   // Remove MCQData interface, consolidate to QuestionItem
   // File: /functions/src/types/index.ts
   ```
   - Migrate all usages from `MCQData` to `QuestionItem`
   - Update import statements across 15+ files
   - Validate schema compatibility in validation layer

2. **Centralize Type Definitions**
   - Move all shared types to `/functions/src/types/index.ts`
   - Remove duplicate type definitions in individual files
   - Update import paths across codebase

#### Success Criteria:
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Single interface for question representation
- Consistent import paths across all files

### 1.2 Authentication System Consolidation
**Objective:** Eliminate dual authentication patterns and security vulnerabilities

#### Current Issues:
- `requireAdmin()` vs `requireAdminByEmail()` inconsistency
- Type safety gaps with `any` types in auth functions
- Privilege escalation risk in `initialSetup.ts`

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Standardize on Single Auth Pattern**
   ```typescript
   // Remove requireAdminByEmail, standardize on requireAdmin
   // Update 65+ usage instances across codebase
   ```

2. **Implement Centralized Auth Logging**
   ```typescript
   // File: /functions/src/util/auth.ts
   export function requireAdminWithLogging(context: CallableContext): AuthenticatedContext {
     const result = requireAdmin(context);
     logSecurityEvent('admin_action', {
       uid: result.auth.uid,
       action: 'admin_auth_check',
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
     });
     return result;
   }
   ```

3. **Secure Initial Setup Function**
